elm-probabilities
=================

Probability distributions and plotting in Elm-lang. 

Layer based plotting of functions, integrals and derivatives  
(inspired by Hadley Wickham's ggplot2 but more narrow in scope)

Discrete
* Binomial
* Hypergeometric
* Poisson

Continuous
* Uniform
* Normal + Standard normal
* Exponential

And some helper functions including:
* Integration
* Derivative
* Normalization
* Combinations and permutations
* Rounding to a set number of decimals
